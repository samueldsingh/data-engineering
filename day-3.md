## About Python
Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level and interpreted programming language.
- **General purpose** means that it can create all kinds of programs
- **Dynamic** refers to the fact that you don't need to assign keywords suchs as int.
- **Dynamic** also means that you can use a variable that was previously assigned an integer can be assigned a string
- **High Level** language is one that is user-oriented in that it has been designed to make it 
straightforward for a programmer to convert an algorithm into program code
- **Interpreted language** 

## 3. Features of Python

1. It is an interpreted language
- There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C, C++, Java
-	Directly run the program from the source code.
-	Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes then translated into native language of specific computer to run it.
-	No need to worry about linking and loading with libraries, etc.

2. Platform independent
- 	Python programs can be developed and executed on multiple operating system platforms.
-	Python can be used on Linux, Windows, Macintosh, Solaris and many more.

3. Free and Open Source: Redistributable
4. High-level Language:
- In Python, no need to take care about low-level details such as managing the memory used by the program.
5. Simple:
- Closer to learning Mathematics basics in English medium. Easy to Learn
- More emphasis on the solution to the problem rather than the syntax
6. Embeddable
- Python can be used within C/C++ program to give scripting capabilities for the program’s users.
7. Robust:
- Exceptional handling features
- Memory management techniques in built
8. Rich Library Support
- The Python Standard Library is very vast.
- Known as the “batteries included” philosophy of Python. It can help do various things involving regular expressions, documentation generation, unit testing, threading, databases, web browsers, CGI, email, XML, HTML, WAV files, cryptography, GUI and many more.
9. Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
10. Easy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
11. Easy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintained
12. Databases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.

## 4. Advantages and disadvantages of python
| Advantages      | Disadvantages |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Readability & Simplicity: code readability, reduces 
the cost of program maintenance and development.      | Performance: Interpreted language perform slowly on computationally intensive tasks      |
| Large standard library: pre-built modules and functions for various tasks such as file I/O, networking, web developement   | Global Interpreter Lock allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, hence the performance to achieve true parallelism in multi-threaded applications is impacted|
| Cross Platform Compatibility: Can run on different operating systems which makes it convenient for developing applications that need to run on multiple platforms.      | Mobile and Game Development: Although frameworks like Kivy and Pygame exist, they may have limitations compared to platform-specific languages like Java, Kotlin, Swift, or C++ .      |
| Rich Ecosystem and Community Support: supportive community that actively contributes to the development of tools, libraries, and resources. This availability of resources simplifies development tasks and promotes collaboration.  | Memory Consumption: due to its dynamic type system and high-level abstractions, building memory-intensive applications can be a concern|
| Integration Capabilities: seamless integration with other languages like C, C++, and Java. It provides interfaces to popular databases, allowing easy data manipulation and management.     | Design Restrictions: the use of whitespace indentation for code blocks can be a challenge for developers accustomed to other programming languages.      |

## 5. Interpreted vs compiled programming languages
Interpreted and compiled languages are two different approaches to executing computer programs.
| Compiled      | Interpreted |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Compilation**: the source code is first passed through a compiler, which translates the entire code into machine-readable instructions called object code or bytecode. The output of the compilation process is usually an executable file or a binary file that can be directly executed by the target machine's processor. | **Interpretation**: In an interpreted language, the source code is directly executed by an interpreter without a separate compilation step. The interpreter reads the code line by line and translates each line into machine instructions or bytecode at runtime. |
| **Execution Process:**: the compiled program is loaded directly into memory and executed by the computer's processor. The machine understands and directly executes the compiled instructions without the need for further translation or interpretation. | **Execution Process**: The interpreter processes and executes each line of code sequentially, translating and executing it on the fly. The interpreter may perform additional tasks like memory management, garbage collection, and error handling during the execution process. |
| **Advantages:**: **Efficiency**: provide faster execution speed because the entire code is translated into machine code upfront. **Portability**: The compiled executable can be run on any machine with a compatible architecture without requiring the presence of the compiler. | **Advantages:**: The interpreter processes and executes each line of code sequentially, translating and executing it on the fly. The interpreter may perform additional tasks like memory management, garbage collection, and error handling during the execution process. |
| **Examples**: C, C++, Java, Rust, Go | **Examples**: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl, PHP |

### Key Differences and Considerations:

**Compilation Time**: Compiled languages require an additional compilation step before execution, which can increase the overall development time compared to interpreted languages.
**Portability**: Interpreted languages are generally more portable because the interpreter can run on different platforms without the need for recompilation.
**Performance**: Compiled languages often offer better performance due to their direct translation into machine code, whereas interpreted languages may have slightly slower execution due to the interpretation process.
**Development and Debugging**: Interpreted languages can provide more interactive and dynamic development and debugging experiences since they can execute code directly without the need for recompilation.

Some languages, like Java and C#, combine elements of interpreted and compiled approaches, using a bytecode compilation step followed by interpretation or just-in-time (JIT) compilation at runtime.

The choice between compiled and interpreted languages depends on various factors, including performance requirements, development speed, platform compatibility, and the specific goals and constraints of the project.

## 6. .py vs .pyc files
In Python, .py and .pyc files serve different purposes:

**.py Files**:

- .py files are the source code files written in Python programming language.
- They contain the human-readable code that developers write and edit.
- These files are plain text files that can be opened and modified using any text editor.
- When you run a .py file, the Python interpreter reads and executes the code directly from the .py file.

**.pyc Files**:

- .pyc files are compiled bytecode files generated by the Python interpreter.
- They are created for performance optimization purposes.
- When a .py file is first imported or executed, the Python interpreter compiles the source code into bytecode, which is a lower-level representation of the code that is easier and faster for the interpreter to execute.
- The compiled bytecode is then stored in a .pyc file, which can be used for subsequent executions to skip the compilation step and improve the startup time of the program.
- .pyc files are platform-specific and not meant to be human-readable or editable.
- If a .pyc file is present and its corresponding .py file has not been modified since the .pyc file was created, the interpreter will use the .pyc file for execution.
- If the .py file is modified, the interpreter will recompile the source code and generate a new .pyc file.

The use of .pyc files provides performance benefits as the compilation step is avoided during subsequent executions, resulting in faster program startup. However, the presence of .pyc files does not change the behavior or functionality of the Python code itself.

It's important to note that .pyc files are automatically generated by the Python interpreter and are usually stored in a pycache directory alongside the .py files. The .pyc files can be safely deleted, and they will be regenerated when the corresponding .py files are executed again.

In summary, .py files contain the human-readable source code written by developers, while .pyc files store the compiled bytecode generated by the Python interpreter for performance optimization purposes.

## 7. How compilation happens internally in Python:
Internally, in CPython (the reference implementation of Python), the compilation process involves several stages and components. Here's a brief overview of how compilation happens internally in Python:
1. **Lexical Analysis (Tokenization):** The source code is read and converted into a sequence of tokens which are identified as keywords, identifiers, literals, operators and other tokens based on the Python language specification. The resulting tokens represent the building blocks of the code.
2. **Parsing (Syntax Analysis):** Using python program rules, a syntax tree is constructed using the stream of tokens and constructs. The syntax tree represents the syntactic structure of the code, capturing the relationships between expressions, statements, and other language constructs.
3. **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Generation:** The parser generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the syntax tree. The AST is a tree-like structure that abstracts away the details of the code and represents the underlying structure in a more concise and manageable form. Each node in the AST represents a different language construct, such as function calls, assignments, loops, conditionals, etc.
4. **Compilation to bytecode:** The AST is then compiled into a lower-level representation known as bytecode. The bytecode is a platform-independent set of instructions that can be executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).
5. **Bytecode execution:** The bytecode is executed by the Python interpreter or the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). The interpreter reads the bytecode instructions one by one, interpreting and executing them to produce the desired output.

It's important to note that Python's compilation process happens dynamically at runtime. When a Python module or script is imported or executed, the compilation steps are performed automatically by the interpreter. The compiled bytecode can be cached in .pyc files to speed up subsequent executions.

## 8. Why Python is a dynamically typed language?
Python is considered a dynamically typed language because the type of a variable is determined and checked at runtime, rather than being explicitly declared or enforced during compile-time. 

Some key reasons why python is dynamically typed:
1. Implicit Type Declaration: Python will automatically infer the type based on the assigned value.
2. Flexible Variable Assignment: Python allows you to reassign variables to different types.
3. Dynamic Type Checking: the type of a variable is checked during the actual execution of the program. 
4. Dynamic Dispatch and Polymorphism: Dynamic typing enables dynamic dispatch and polymorphism, allowing different objects to respond differently to the same method or function call based on their actual types. This flexibility enables powerful abstraction and code reuse.

Advantages of Dynamic Typing:
1. Enhanced Flexibility: allows variables to hold different types of values, facilitating rapid prototyping and quick iterations during development.
2. Expressiveness: reduces the need for explicit type declarations, resulting in cleaner and more readable code.
3. Quick and Easy Development: eliminates the need for lengthy type annotations, which can speed up the development process and reduce boilerplate code.

Disadvantages of Dynamic Typing:
1. **Runtime Errors**: The lack of compile-time type checking in dynamic typing can lead to runtime errors
2. **Reduced Performance**: can introduce some overhead compared to statically typed languages, as type checks and conversions are performed at runtime.

## 9. Python is platform independent. Explain?
Python is often regarded as a platform-independent language due to its ability to run on various operating systems and hardware platforms without requiring extensive modifications to the code. Here's an explanation of how Python achieves platform independence:
1. Interpreted language: the source code is executed by an interpreter.  The interpreter reads the source code, converts it into bytecode (a low-level representation), and executes it using a virtual machine.
2. Abstraction from Low-Level Details: It allows developers to write code that is independent of the underlying hardware or operating system by abstracting many
low-level details and system-specific intricacies.
3. Cross-Platform Libraries and Modules: a rich ecosystem of cross-platform libraries and modules that provide functionality for a wide range of tasks allowing developers to write code that can be executed on multiple operating systems without modification.
4. Bytecode and Virtual Machine: When Python source code is executed, it is compiled into bytecode, which is a platform-independent representation of the code. 
5. Portability of Python Interpreter: The Python interpreter itself is implemented in a platform-independent manner. For example, CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is written in C and can be compiled and run on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and more. 
6. Standardized Language Specification: Python has a well-defined language specification (e.g., Python Language Reference) that serves as a standard for implementing Python interpreters across different platforms. 

## 10. Different ways to write python programs and their advantages and disadvantages:
|      | Advantages | Disadvantages      | Examples |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|  IDE's    | Flexible and customizable. Support for syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging. Suitable for both small scripts and large projects. | Requires manual saving and execution. Lack some advanced features of specialized environments. Setup and configuration may be required.      |  Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Atom, IDLE |
|  CLI    | Lightweight and readily available. Convenient for running short scripts and one-liners. Useful for automation and scripting tasks. | No integrated editor or advanced features. Limited in terms of code editing and debugging capabilities. Execution parameters need to be specified explicitly.      | Command Prompt (Windows), Terminal (macOS and Linux) |
|  Jupyter Notebooks    | Interactive and supports a mix of code, text, and visualizations. Great for data exploration, prototyping, and sharing analyses. Allows executing code cells individually. | Less suitable for large-scale projects. Limited support for refactoring and code organization. Not designed for traditional software development workflows.     | Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab |
|    Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with Notebook-like capabilities:  | Combines features of traditional IDEs and Jupyter notebooks. Provides an integrated environment for coding, debugging, and data analysis. Offers the flexibility of notebooks within a larger development ecosystem. | Requires additional setup and configuration. Can be resource-intensive, especially for large notebooks. Might have a steeper learning curve compared to simpler options.      | Spyder, PyCharm, VS Code with Jupyter extensions |

## 11. Source code vs Bytecode
Source code and bytecode are different representations of a program that serve different purposes in the execution process. 
| Source Code     | Bytecode |
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| Source code is the human-readable form of a program written in a programming language like Python.     | Bytecode is an intermediate representation of the source code that is generated during the compilation or interpretation process. |
| It is composed of text-based instructions and high-level language constructs that are easily understood by developers.    | It is a lower-level form of code that is closer to machine language but is still platform-independent. |
| Source code is written by programmers and serves as the input for the compilation or interpretation process.    | Bytecode is designed to be executed by a virtual machine or interpreter rather than directly by the hardware. |
| It typically has a file extension of ".py" in Python.    | It is often stored in files with a ".pyc" extension (compiled bytecode) for caching and faster subsequent executions. |
|    | Bytecode can be executed more efficiently than source code because it has already undergone some level of translation and optimization. |

## 14. Python Architecture
The Python architecture refers to the overall structure and components involved in the execution of Python programs. Here's an overview of the Python architecture:

1. Source Code:
- The source code that contains the instructions and logic written by the developer are written in plain text files with a .py extension.

2. Python Interpreter:
- The Python interpreter reads and executes Python code line by line, transforming it into the desired output or behavior.
- The default interpreter for Python is CPython, but other implementations like Jython, IronPython, and PyPy are also available.

3. Lexical Analysis and Parsing:
- The interpreter performs lexical analysis, also known as tokenization or scanning, to break down the source code into individual tokens such as keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.
- The token stream is then parsed according to the Python grammar rules to create an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) which represents the syntactic structure of the code and guides the subsequent execution steps.

4. Compilation to Bytecode
- After parsing, the Python interpreter compiles the AST into bytecode which is a lower-level representation of the code that can be executed by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).
- The bytecode is stored in .pyc files for caching and reuse in subsequent executions.

5. Python Virtual Machine (PVM)
- The reads and interprets the bytecode instructions, performing the necessary operations to produce the desired output.
- The PVM manages memory, executes instructions, handles exceptions, and provides the runtime environment for Python programs.

6. Standard Library and Built-in Modules:
- Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides a wide range of modules and functions for common programming tasks.
- The standard library includes modules for file I/O, networking, regular expressions, data manipulation, and much more.
- Additionally, Python has built-in modules that provide essential functionality, such as math, string manipulation, and system-level operations.

7. Third-Party Libraries and Modules:
- Third-party libraries and modules for various domains such as web development, scientific computing, machine learning, data analysis, and more are developed by the community.

8. Execution and Output:
- Once the bytecode is executed by the PVM, the Python program produces the desired output or performs the specified behavior.
- Output can be displayed in the console, written to files, or interacted with through GUI interfaces, depending on the program's design.

The Python architecture is designed to provide a high-level and versatile programming environment. It offers features such as dynamic typing, automatic memory management, extensive libraries, and cross-platform compatibility. The combination of the Python interpreter, bytecode compilation, the PVM, and the vast ecosystem of libraries contributes to the popularity and effectiveness of the Python programming language.

## 15. Explain Garbage Collection mechanism in detail.
Garbage collection is a memory management mechanism used in programming languages to automatically reclaim memory that is no longer in use by the program. It ensures efficient memory utilization and relieves developers from manually deallocating memory. 

Here's a detailed explanation of the garbage collection mechanism:
1. Memory allocation: When an object is created memory is allocated to store its data and attributes dynamically during runtime. The Python runtime keeps track of allocated memory and manages its lifecycle.

2. Reference counting: The primary garbage collection technique used in Python is reference counting. Each object in memory has a reference count, which is the number of references to that object. The reference count is incremented or decremented whenever is created or deleted.
3. Circular reference:
