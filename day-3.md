## About Python
Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level and interpreted programming language.
- **General purpose** means that it can create all kinds of programs
- **Dynamic** refers to the fact that you don't need to assign keywords suchs as int.
- **Dynamic** also means that you can use a variable that was previously assigned an integer can be assigned a string
- **High Level** language is one that is user-oriented in that it has been designed to make it 
straightforward for a programmer to convert an algorithm into program code
- **Interpreted language** 

## Features of Python

1. It is an interpreted language
- There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C, C++, Java
-	Directly run the program from the source code.
-	Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes then translated into native language of specific computer to run it.
-	No need to worry about linking and loading with libraries, etc.

2. Platform independent
- 	Python programs can be developed and executed on multiple operating system platforms.
-	Python can be used on Linux, Windows, Macintosh, Solaris and many more.

3. Free and Open Source: Redistributable
4. High-level Language:
- In Python, no need to take care about low-level details such as managing the memory used by the program.
5. Simple:
- Closer to learning Mathematics basics in English medium. Easy to Learn
- More emphasis on the solution to the problem rather than the syntax
6. Embeddable
- Python can be used within C/C++ program to give scripting capabilities for the program’s users.
7. Robust:
- Exceptional handling features
- Memory management techniques in built
8. Rich Library Support
- The Python Standard Library is very vast.
- Known as the “batteries included” philosophy of Python. It can help do various things involving regular expressions, documentation generation, unit testing, threading, databases, web browsers, CGI, email, XML, HTML, WAV files, cryptography, GUI and many more.
9. Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
10. Easy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
11. Easy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintained
12. Databases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.
