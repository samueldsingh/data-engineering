## About Python
Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level and interpreted programming language.
- **General purpose** means that it can create all kinds of programs
- **Dynamic** refers to the fact that you don't need to assign keywords suchs as int.
- **Dynamic** also means that you can use a variable that was previously assigned an integer can be assigned a string
- **High Level** language is one that is user-oriented in that it has been designed to make it 
straightforward for a programmer to convert an algorithm into program code
- **Interpreted language** 

## Features of Python

## It is an interpreted language
- There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C, C++, Java
-	Directly run the program from the source code.
-	Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes then translated into native language of specific computer to run it.
-	No need to worry about linking and loading with libraries, etc.
