## About Python
Python is a general purpose, dynamic, high-level and interpreted programming language.
- **General purpose** means that it can create all kinds of programs
- **Dynamic** refers to the fact that you don't need to assign keywords suchs as int.
- **Dynamic** also means that you can use a variable that was previously assigned an integer can be assigned a string
- **High Level** language is one that is user-oriented in that it has been designed to make it 
straightforward for a programmer to convert an algorithm into program code
- **Interpreted language** 

## 3. Features of Python

1. It is an interpreted language
- There are no separate compilation and execution steps like C, C++, Java
-	Directly run the program from the source code.
-	Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate form called bytecodes then translated into native language of specific computer to run it.
-	No need to worry about linking and loading with libraries, etc.

2. Platform independent
- 	Python programs can be developed and executed on multiple operating system platforms.
-	Python can be used on Linux, Windows, Macintosh, Solaris and many more.

3. Free and Open Source: Redistributable
4. High-level Language:
- In Python, no need to take care about low-level details such as managing the memory used by the program.
5. Simple:
- Closer to learning Mathematics basics in English medium. Easy to Learn
- More emphasis on the solution to the problem rather than the syntax
6. Embeddable
- Python can be used within C/C++ program to give scripting capabilities for the program’s users.
7. Robust:
- Exceptional handling features
- Memory management techniques in built
8. Rich Library Support
- The Python Standard Library is very vast.
- Known as the “batteries included” philosophy of Python. It can help do various things involving regular expressions, documentation generation, unit testing, threading, databases, web browsers, CGI, email, XML, HTML, WAV files, cryptography, GUI and many more.
9. Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
10. Easy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
11. Easy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintained
12. Databases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.

## 4. Advantages and disadvantages of python
| Advantages      | Disadvantages |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Readability & Simplicity: code readability, reduces 
the cost of program maintenance and development.      | Performance: Interpreted language perform slowly on computationally intensive tasks      |
| Large standard library: pre-built modules and functions for various tasks such as file I/O, networking, web developement   | Global Interpreter Lock allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, hence the performance to achieve true parallelism in multi-threaded applications is impacted|
| Cross Platform Compatibility: Can run on different operating systems which makes it convenient for developing applications that need to run on multiple platforms.      | Mobile and Game Development: Although frameworks like Kivy and Pygame exist, they may have limitations compared to platform-specific languages like Java, Kotlin, Swift, or C++ .      |
| Rich Ecosystem and Community Support: supportive community that actively contributes to the development of tools, libraries, and resources. This availability of resources simplifies development tasks and promotes collaboration.  | Memory Consumption: due to its dynamic type system and high-level abstractions, building memory-intensive applications can be a concern|
| Integration Capabilities: seamless integration with other languages like C, C++, and Java. It provides interfaces to popular databases, allowing easy data manipulation and management.     | Design Restrictions: the use of whitespace indentation for code blocks can be a challenge for developers accustomed to other programming languages.      |

## 5. Interpreted vs compiled programming languages
Interpreted and compiled languages are two different approaches to executing computer programs.
| Compiled      | Interpreted |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Compilation**: the source code is first passed through a compiler, which translates the entire code into machine-readable instructions called object code or bytecode. The output of the compilation process is usually an executable file or a binary file that can be directly executed by the target machine's processor. | **Interpretation**: In an interpreted language, the source code is directly executed by an interpreter without a separate compilation step. The interpreter reads the code line by line and translates each line into machine instructions or bytecode at runtime. |
| **Execution Process:**: the compiled program is loaded directly into memory and executed by the computer's processor. The machine understands and directly executes the compiled instructions without the need for further translation or interpretation. | **Execution Process**: The interpreter processes and executes each line of code sequentially, translating and executing it on the fly. The interpreter may perform additional tasks like memory management, garbage collection, and error handling during the execution process. |
| **Advantages:**: **Efficiency**: provide faster execution speed because the entire code is translated into machine code upfront. **Portability**: The compiled executable can be run on any machine with a compatible architecture without requiring the presence of the compiler. | **Advantages:**: The interpreter processes and executes each line of code sequentially, translating and executing it on the fly. The interpreter may perform additional tasks like memory management, garbage collection, and error handling during the execution process. |
| **Examples**: C, C++, Java, Rust, Go | **Examples**: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl, PHP |

### Key Differences and Considerations:

**Compilation Time**: Compiled languages require an additional compilation step before execution, which can increase the overall development time compared to interpreted languages.
**Portability**: Interpreted languages are generally more portable because the interpreter can run on different platforms without the need for recompilation.
**Performance**: Compiled languages often offer better performance due to their direct translation into machine code, whereas interpreted languages may have slightly slower execution due to the interpretation process.
**Development and Debugging**: Interpreted languages can provide more interactive and dynamic development and debugging experiences since they can execute code directly without the need for recompilation.

Some languages, like Java and C#, combine elements of interpreted and compiled approaches, using a bytecode compilation step followed by interpretation or just-in-time (JIT) compilation at runtime.

The choice between compiled and interpreted languages depends on various factors, including performance requirements, development speed, platform compatibility, and the specific goals and constraints of the project.

## 6. .py vs .pyc files
In Python, .py and .pyc files serve different purposes:

**.py Files**:

- .py files are the source code files written in Python programming language.
- They contain the human-readable code that developers write and edit.
- These files are plain text files that can be opened and modified using any text editor.
- When you run a .py file, the Python interpreter reads and executes the code directly from the .py file.

**.pyc Files**:

- .pyc files are compiled bytecode files generated by the Python interpreter.
- They are created for performance optimization purposes.
- When a .py file is first imported or executed, the Python interpreter compiles the source code into bytecode, which is a lower-level representation of the code that is easier and faster for the interpreter to execute.
- The compiled bytecode is then stored in a .pyc file, which can be used for subsequent executions to skip the compilation step and improve the startup time of the program.
- .pyc files are platform-specific and not meant to be human-readable or editable.
- If a .pyc file is present and its corresponding .py file has not been modified since the .pyc file was created, the interpreter will use the .pyc file for execution.
- If the .py file is modified, the interpreter will recompile the source code and generate a new .pyc file.
