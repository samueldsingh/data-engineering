## How are objects stored in Python
In C, C++, and Java we have variables and objects. A Python object is stored in memory with **names and references**. 
A name is just a label for an object, so one object can have many names. 
A reference is a name(pointer) that refers to an object.

A python object has 3 things -  Type, value, and reference count. As python is a dynamic language, the type is automatically detected. Value is 
declared while defining the object. Reference count is the number of names pointing that object. 

## Explain Garbage Collection in detail
Garbage collection releases memory when no object is in use. It is like a recycling system in computers where the system deletes the unused object and 
reuses its memory slot for new objects.

- Python has an automated garbage collection system.
- Python has algorithms to deallocate objects and it has two ways to delete the unused objects from the memory.

1. Reference Counting - Suppose we assign c to 50. Next, when we assign a new variable to the object c, the reference count increases by 1.
For now we print the ID's of each object to see if they are the same or different.

Next we change the value of ```a``` to ```60```, and then to ```None```. The integer 60 has no reference and it is deleted by the garbage collection.

Now we assign a boolean, ```False``` to ```b```. The previous integer object, ```60``` is not deleted because it still has a reference by ```c```.

When we delete **c**, we decrease the reference count to **c** by one.

The ```del()``` statement doesnâ€™t delete objects, it removes the name (and reference) to the object. When the reference count is zero, the object is deleted from the system by the garbage collection.
