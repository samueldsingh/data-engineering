SQL functions are pre-defined or user-defined routines that accept zero or more arguments and return a value or a table result. They are used to perform various operations on data within an SQL database. SQL functions are categorized into several types based on their functionality. Let's dive into the details of SQL functions:

**1. Built-in (System) Functions:**
   These functions are provided by the database management system and are available for use without any additional setup.

   - **Scalar Functions:** These functions operate on a single input value and return a single output value. Examples include:
     - `CONCAT`: Concatenates two or more strings.
     - `LOWER`, `UPPER`: Converts a string to lowercase or uppercase.
     - `LEN`, `CHAR_LENGTH`: Returns the length of a string.
     - `ROUND`, `FLOOR`, `CEIL`: Perform rounding and ceiling/floor operations on numeric values.
    
   ```
-- CONCAT function to concatenate two strings
SELECT CONCAT('Hello', ' ', 'World');  -- Output: 'Hello World'

-- LEN function to get the length of a string
SELECT LEN('Database');  -- Output: 8

-- ROUND function to round a numeric value
SELECT ROUND(5.678);  -- Output: 6
   ```

   Other scalar functions:

Certainly! Here are examples of each of the SQL functions you mentioned:

- The `UCASE()` function converts a string to uppercase.

```sql
SELECT UCASE('hello world');  -- Output: 'HELLO WORLD'
```

- The `LCASE()` function converts a string to lowercase.

```sql
SELECT LCASE('Hello World');  -- Output: 'hello world'
```

- The `MID()` function extracts a substring from a string starting at a specified position.

```sql
SELECT MID('abcdef', 2, 3);  -- Output: 'bcd'
```

- The `LENGTH()` function returns the length of a string.

```sql
SELECT LENGTH('database');  -- Output: 8
```

- The `ROUND()` function rounds a numeric value to a specified number of decimal places.

```sql
SELECT ROUND(5.678, 1);  -- Output: 5.7
```

- The `NOW()` function returns the current date and time.

```sql
SELECT NOW();  -- Output: Current date and time
```


- The `FORMAT()` function formats a numeric value with a specified format.

```sql
SELECT FORMAT(1234567.89, 'C', 'en-US');  -- Output: '$1,234,567.89'
```

Please note that the availability and syntax of these functions may vary slightly based on the specific database system you are using. The examples provided are based on general SQL syntax.


   - **Aggregate Functions:** These functions operate on a set of values and return a single value. They are used with the `GROUP BY` clause for grouping and summarizing data. Examples include:
     - `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `STDDEV`, `VARIANCE`: Perform arithmetic operations on numeric values.
     - `COUNT`: Counts the number of rows or non-null values in a column.
     - `GROUP_CONCAT` (MySQL), `STRING_AGG` (PostgreSQL): Concatenates values from multiple rows into a single string.

```
-- SUM function to calculate the total of a column
SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;  -- Sum of salaries

-- COUNT function to count the number of rows
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;  -- Number of orders

-- AVG function to calculate the average of a column
SELECT AVG(age) FROM customers;  -- Average age of customers

-- Calculate the standard deviation of salary for employees
SELECT STDDEV(salary) AS standard_deviation
FROM employees;

-- Calculate the variance of age for customers
SELECT VARIANCE(age) AS variance
FROM customers;

-- CONCAT all the product names for each order
SELECT order_id, GROUP_CONCAT(product_name ORDER BY product_name ASC SEPARATOR ', ') AS products
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_id;

SELECT order_id, STRING_AGG(product_name, ', ' ORDER BY product_name ASC) AS products
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_id;
```

   - **Date and Time Functions:** These functions operate on date and time values. Examples include:
     - `NOW`, `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`: Returns the current date and time.
     - `DATEADD`, `DATEDIFF`: Performs date arithmetic operations.
     - `DATE_FORMAT`, `TO_CHAR`: Formats date and time values as strings.

```
-- NOW function to get the current date and time
SELECT NOW();  -- Current date and time

-- DATEADD function to add days to a date
SELECT DATEADD(DAY, 7, '2023-08-01');  -- Adds 7 days to the given date

-- DATE_FORMAT function to format date as a string
SELECT DATE_FORMAT('2023-08-04', '%Y-%m-%d');  -- Output: '2023-08-04'
```

**2. User-Defined Functions (UDFs):**
   Some database systems allow you to define your own functions using SQL or procedural languages like PL/SQL, T-SQL, or PL/pgSQL. UDFs can simplify complex queries and encapsulate business logic.

**3. Window Functions (Analytic Functions):**
   These functions operate on a "window" of rows related to the current row. They are used with the `OVER` clause and are often used for analytical calculations. Examples include:
   - `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, `DENSE_RANK`: Assigns unique numbers to rows within a window.
   - `LAG`, `LEAD`: Access values from previous or subsequent rows.
   - `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX` with `OVER`: Perform calculations over a window of rows.

```
-- ROW_NUMBER function to assign row numbers
SELECT emp_name, salary, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
FROM employees;

-- SUM function with OVER clause for running total
SELECT order_date, order_amount, SUM(order_amount) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total
FROM orders;
```

**4. String Functions:**
   These functions operate on string values and are often used for text manipulation and formatting. Examples include `SUBSTRING`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `TRIM`, `REPLACE`.

```
-- SUBSTRING function to extract a substring
SELECT SUBSTRING('Hello World', 7);  -- Output: 'World'

-- TRIM function to remove leading and trailing spaces
SELECT TRIM('   Text   ');  -- Output: 'Text'

-- REPLACE function to replace a substring
SELECT REPLACE('Hello', 'H', 'J');  -- Output: 'Jello'
```

**5. Mathematical Functions:**
   These functions perform mathematical operations on numeric values. Examples include `ABS`, `SQUARE`, `POWER`, `SQRT`.

```
-- ABS function to get the absolute value
SELECT ABS(-10);  -- Output: 10

-- POWER function to calculate power
SELECT POWER(2, 3);  -- Output: 8

-- SQRT function to calculate square root
SELECT SQRT(25);  -- Output: 5
```

**6. Conversion Functions:**
   These functions convert values from one data type to another. Examples include `CAST`, `CONVERT`.

```
-- CAST function to convert a value to a different data type
SELECT CAST('123' AS INT);  -- Output: 123

-- CONVERT function to change data type
SELECT CONVERT('2023-08-04', DATE);  -- Output: '2023-08-04'
```

**7. Conditional Functions:**
   These functions evaluate conditions and return different values based on the outcome. Examples include `CASE`, `COALESCE`, `NULLIF`.

```
-- CASE statement to conditionally return values
SELECT 
    order_id,
    CASE
        WHEN order_amount > 1000 THEN 'High'
        WHEN order_amount > 500 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'Low'
    END AS order_priority
FROM orders;
```

**8. Special Functions:**
   Some databases provide functions specific to their features. For example, PostgreSQL has JSON functions for working with JSON data, while MySQL has spatial functions for geographical data.

**9. Scalar vs. Table-Valued Functions:**
   - Scalar functions return a single value.
   - Table-valued functions return a table as a result.

SQL functions play a crucial role in database queries and data manipulation. They help optimize queries, encapsulate logic, and make complex operations more manageable. Each database system may have variations in syntax and function availability, so it's important to consult the documentation specific to your chosen database.

**10. Commonly used functions:**
Certainly! Here are examples for each of the SQL functions you mentioned, along with sample outputs:

- **BIT_AND() - Bitwise AND:**

| Bob           | 60000  |
| Carol         | 55000  |

```sql
-- Create a JSON object of employee names and salaries
SELECT JSON_OBJECTAGG(employee_name, salary) AS json_object
FROM employee_salaries;
```

Output: `{"Alice": 50000, "Bob": 60000, "Carol": 55000}`

- **STDDEV_POP() - Population Standard Deviation:**

Suppose you have a table named `exam_scores` with a column named `score`:

| score |

| 90    |
| 78    |
| 92    |

```sql
-- Calculate population standard deviation of exam scores
SELECT STDDEV_POP(score) AS population_stddev
FROM exam_scores;
```
