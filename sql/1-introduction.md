# Introduction

## 1. What is DBMS and RDBMS?

**DBMS (Database Management System):**

A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that allows users to interact with a database. It provides a set of tools and functionalities to store, retrieve, update, and manage data efficiently and securely. The main purpose of a DBMS is to provide an organized and structured way to manage data, ensuring data integrity, consistency, and security. Some key features of a DBMS include:

1. Data Organization: DBMS provides methods to organize data into tables, rows, and columns, creating a structured representation of data.

2. Data Retrieval: Users can query the database to retrieve specific data based on certain conditions using SQL (Structured Query Language).

3. Data Manipulation: DBMS allows users to insert, update, and delete data in the database, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

4. Data Security: DBMS provides access control mechanisms to secure data from unauthorized access and ensure data privacy.

5. Data Concurrency: DBMS handles multiple user access to the data concurrently, preventing conflicts and maintaining data consistency.

6. Data Recovery: DBMS has built-in mechanisms for data backup and recovery, protecting data from accidental loss or corruption.

**RDBMS (Relational Database Management System):**

RDBMS is a type of DBMS that manages data in a relational database model. In the relational model, data is organized into tables with rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established using keys. The key feature of RDBMS is the ability to enforce relationships and constraints between tables through the use of primary keys, foreign keys, and other integrity constraints. Some popular RDBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.

**Key characteristics of RDBMS:**

1. Tabular Structure: Data is represented in tables, where each table consists of rows (records) and columns (attributes).

2. Data Integrity: RDBMS enforces integrity constraints such as primary keys, unique keys, foreign keys, and check constraints to maintain data accuracy and consistency.

3. SQL Support: RDBMS uses SQL to perform operations on data, making it easy for users to interact with the database.

4. Normalization: RDBMS encourages data normalization to eliminate data redundancy and improve data integrity.

5. ACID Properties: RDBMS follows ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to ensure data transactions are reliable and recoverable.

6. Data Relationships: RDBMS allows the establishment of relationships between tables using keys, enabling efficient data retrieval through joins.

In summary, both DBMS and RDBMS are software systems used to manage data, but RDBMS is a specific type of DBMS that follows the relational model, providing structured data organization and enforcing data relationships through keys and integrity constraints.

## 2. Examples of DBMS and RDBMS:


There are several types of Database Management Systems (DBMS) based on their data models, architectures, and functionalities. Here are some of the most common types of DBMS:

DBMS (Database Management System):

1. **MongoDB:** MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system that stores data in a flexible JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). It is designed for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and is commonly used in modern web applications.

2. **NoSQL Database Management System:** NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data and provide flexible schemas. They include various types:

   - **Key-Value Stores:** Store data as key-value pairs. Examples include Redis and Amazon DynamoDB.
   - **Columnar Databases:** Store data in columns rather than rows. Examples include Apache Cassandra and HBase.
   - **Graph Databases:** Store data in nodes and edges to represent relationships. Examples include Neo4j and Amazon Neptune.

3. **Object-Oriented Database Management System (OODBMS):** These databases extend the object-oriented programming paradigm to databases. They store objects with attributes and methods. Examples include ObjectDB and Versant.

4. **XML Databases:** Designed to store and query XML data. They are suitable for applications that work extensively with XML. Examples include BaseX and eXist-db.

5. **Time-Series Databases:** Optimized for storing and querying time-series data, which is data collected over time. Examples include InfluxDB and TimescaleDB.

6. **NewSQL Databases:** These databases aim to combine the benefits of traditional relational databases with the scalability of NoSQL databases. Examples include CockroachDB and NuoDB.

7. **In-Memory Databases:** Store data in main memory (RAM) rather than on disk for faster access. Examples include Redis (for caching) and SAP HANA.

8. **Columnar Databases:** Organize data by columns instead of rows, making them suitable for analytical queries and data warehousing. Examples include Apache Cassandra and Google Bigtable.

9. **Spatial Databases:** Designed to manage spatial and geographic data. They support spatial data types and queries for location-based applications. Examples include PostGIS and Oracle Spatial.

10. **Multimodal Databases:** Store and manage different types of data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured) in a single database. Examples include ArangoDB and OrientDB.

11. **Distributed Databases:** Store data across multiple servers or nodes to achieve scalability and fault tolerance. Examples include Apache Hadoop (HDFS) and Amazon DynamoDB.

12. **Cloud Databases:** Hosted on cloud platforms, these databases provide scalability, ease of deployment, and management. Examples include Amazon RDS, Google Cloud SQL, and Azure SQL Database.

Each type of DBMS serves specific use cases and requirements, and the choice of the appropriate DBMS depends on factors such as the nature of the data, scalability needs, performance requirements, and the overall architecture of the application.

13. **Couchbase:** Couchbase is a NoSQL database management system that supports both document-oriented and key-value data models. It is known for its high performance and scalability and is used in applications that require fast data access and low-latency response times.

14. **Redis:** Redis is an in-memory data structure store that can function as a database, cache, and message broker. It is widely used for caching frequently accessed data and supporting real-time data analytics.

RDBMS (Relational Database Management System):

1. **MySQL:** MySQL is an open-source relational database management system known for its speed, reliability, and ease of use. It is widely used in web applications and is the default database for popular content management systems like WordPress.

2. **PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL is an advanced open-source relational database management system that supports a wide range of features, including custom data types, full-text search, and geospatial data. It is known for its extensibility and adherence to SQL standards.

3. **Oracle Database:** Oracle Database is a commercial relational database management system developed by Oracle Corporation. It is one of the most popular RDBMS used in enterprise applications and large-scale systems, known for its scalability and high performance.

4. **Microsoft SQL Server:** SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. It is commonly used in Windows-based environments and integrates well with Microsoft's development tools and products.

5. **SQLite:** SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, and self-contained relational database management system. It is commonly used in mobile applications, embedded systems, and as a local database for desktop applications.

6. **IBM Db2:** Db2 is a family of data management products developed by IBM. It is known for its integration with IBM's mainframe systems and is used in enterprise-level applications.

These examples represent a small subset of the many database management systems available, each with its own strengths and best-suited use cases. The choice of a particular DBMS or RDBMS depends on the specific requirements of the application, the complexity of data, scalability needs, and other factors.


## 3. Explain what are ACID properties
ACID properties are a set of four key characteristics that ensure the reliability and consistency of transactions in a database system. These properties are essential for maintaining data integrity and providing a robust environment for data management. The term "ACID" stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. Let's explore each of these properties in detail:

**1. Atomicity:**
Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. It means that either all the operations within a transaction are successfully completed, or none of them are. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database is left unchanged. This property ensures that the database remains in a consistent state, and partial updates are not allowed.

**2. Consistency:**
Consistency guarantees that a transaction brings the database from one consistent state to another consistent state. In other words, the database must adhere to a set of predefined rules or constraints before and after a transaction. If a transaction violates any of these rules, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database remains unchanged. Consistency ensures that data remains accurate and valid throughout the transaction.

**3. Isolation:**
Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions are executed independently of each other. It prevents interference between transactions and ensures that each transaction sees the database in a consistent state. Transactions are executed as if they were the only ones running on the system, even when multiple transactions are happening simultaneously. This property prevents issues like data corruption and ensures data integrity even in a multi-user environment.

**4. Durability:**
Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanent and will survive any subsequent system failures, such as power outages or crashes. The changes made by a committed transaction are stored in non-volatile memory (usually disk storage) and remain in the database even in the event of a system failure. This property ensures that data is not lost, providing a high level of reliability and recoverability.

The ACID properties are crucial for maintaining data integrity, consistency, and reliability in database management systems. These properties ensure that transactions are executed reliably and that the database remains in a consistent and accurate state even in the presence of failures or concurrent access by multiple users.


## 4. Explain the differences betweeen database and a schema
Database and schema are related concepts in the field of database management, but they refer to different aspects of organizing and managing data:

**1. Database:**
A database is a collection of related data that is organized and structured to be stored, accessed, and managed efficiently. It can be thought of as a container that holds tables, views, procedures, and other objects that represent data and define its relationships. Databases are designed to manage large volumes of data and provide a structured way to store, retrieve, update, and delete information.

In the context of database management systems (DBMS), a database is a physical or logical container that stores data in files on disk or in-memory structures. Databases can be relational (RDBMS), NoSQL, graph-based, or other types, each offering specific data storage and retrieval mechanisms suited to different use cases.

For example, you might have a database named "CompanyDB" that contains tables for employees, departments, and projects, all related to the operations of a company.

**2. Schema:**
A schema, on the other hand, defines the structure and organization of the database. It is a *logical blueprint* that outlines the layout of the database, including the tables, their columns, data types, relationships, and constraints. The schema provides a clear definition of how data is stored and how different pieces of information are related to each other.

In a relational database management system (RDBMS), a schema is a collection of database objects, including tables, views, indexes, stored procedures, and other elements that define the database structure. A schema can be considered as a namespace that groups related database objects together.

For example, within the "CompanyDB" database, you might have different schemas like "HumanResources" and "Finance," each containing tables and views related to their respective departments.

In summary, a database is a container that holds related data, while a schema is a logical blueprint that defines the structure and organization of the database. The schema provides a way to organize and categorize the database objects, making it easier to manage and maintain the data within the database.


## 5. Difference between DELETE, DROP and TRUNCATE

In SQL, `DELETE`, `DROP`, and `TRUNCATE` are three different commands that serve distinct purposes when dealing with database tables and data:

1. **DELETE**:
   - The `DELETE` command is used to remove specific rows from a table based on a specified condition.
   - It can be used with the `WHERE` clause to specify which rows to delete.
   - It is a DML (Data Manipulation Language) operation.
   - The `DELETE` command is slower than `TRUNCATE` as it generates individual delete operations for each row.

   Example:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR';
   ```

2. **DROP**:
   - The `DROP` command is used to remove an entire database object, such as a table, index, or view.
   - It permanently removes the object from the database.
   - It is a DDL (Data Definition Language) operation.
   - Be cautious when using `DROP` as it cannot be undone, and all associated data will be lost.

   Example:
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE employees;
   ```

3. **TRUNCATE**:
   - The `TRUNCATE` command is used to remove all rows from a table while preserving the table structure.
   - It is faster than the `DELETE` command as it doesn't generate individual delete operations for each row.
   - It is a DDL operation.
   - It is often used when you want to remove all data from a table without removing the table itself.

   Example:
   ```sql
   TRUNCATE TABLE orders;
   ```

In summary, the main differences between `DELETE`, `DROP`, and `TRUNCATE` are in their purposes and effects on the database:
- `DELETE` removes specific rows from a table based on a condition.
- `DROP` removes an entire database object permanently.
- `TRUNCATE` removes all rows from a table while keeping the table structure intact and is faster than `DELETE`.

It's important to choose the appropriate command based on your specific use case and the outcome you intend to achieve.

## 6. Primary Key, Foreign Key and Integrity Constraints in RDBMS:

In a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), primary keys, foreign keys, and integrity constraints are essential concepts for maintaining data integrity and ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the database. Here's an explanation of each of these terms:

1. **Primary Key**:
   - A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that each row in the table is uniquely identified and can be used to retrieve and manipulate data.
   - A primary key constraint enforces the uniqueness and non-nullability of the key column(s).
   - In most cases, a primary key is composed of one or more columns that uniquely identify a row.
   - Primary keys are used as reference points for establishing relationships between tables.

2. **Foreign Key**:
   - A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that is used to establish a link between the data in two tables.
   - The foreign key in one table refers to the primary key in another table, creating a relationship between the two tables.
   - Foreign key constraints ensure that the values in the foreign key column(s) correspond to values in the referenced primary key column(s).
   - Foreign keys are used to enforce referential integrity, which maintains the consistency and accuracy of data across related tables.

3. **Integrity Constraints**:
   - Integrity constraints are rules defined on database tables to ensure the validity and accuracy of data.
   - They help maintain data integrity by enforcing certain conditions on the data that is inserted, updated, or deleted from the tables.
   - Common integrity constraints include:
     - Primary Key Constraint: Ensures uniqueness and non-nullability of primary key columns.
     - Foreign Key Constraint: Enforces referential integrity between tables by ensuring values in the foreign key match values in the primary key.
     - Unique Constraint: Ensures uniqueness of values in specified columns.
     - Check Constraint: Enforces a specific condition on a column's values.
     - Not Null Constraint: Ensures that a column cannot contain null values.

Integrity constraints and key relationships are fundamental in ensuring data consistency and accuracy within a relational database. They prevent the creation of inconsistent, redundant, or incorrect data entries, and they provide a structured way to model and maintain relationships between tables.

## 7. Difference between SQL and NoSQL Databases.

SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are two different types of database management systems, each designed to cater to different types of data and use cases. Here's a comparison of the key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

**Data Model:**

1. **SQL:**
   - SQL databases use a structured data model with predefined schemas.
   - Data is organized into tables with rows and columns, where each column has a specific data type.
   - Relationships between tables are established using foreign keys.

2. **NoSQL:**
   - NoSQL databases use flexible and schema-less data models.
   - Data is stored in collections, documents, graphs, or key-value pairs, depending on the type of NoSQL database.
   - Relationships can be established, but they are typically more flexible and may not follow strict referential integrity rules.

**Scalability:**

1. **SQL:**
   - Traditional SQL databases are typically designed for vertical scaling (scaling up by adding more resources to a single server).
   - Scaling horizontally (adding more servers to distribute the load) can be challenging for large-scale applications.

2. **NoSQL:**
   - NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, making it easier to distribute data across multiple servers or nodes.

**Data Consistency:**

1. **SQL:**
   - SQL databases provide strong data consistency with ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.
   - Transactions are used to ensure data integrity.

2. **NoSQL:**
   - NoSQL databases often prioritize availability and partition tolerance over strong consistency.
   - Different types of NoSQL databases offer various consistency models, including eventual consistency.

**Query Language:**

1. **SQL:**
   - SQL databases use the SQL query language for data manipulation and retrieval.
   - SQL provides a standardized way to query and manage data.

2. **NoSQL:**
   - NoSQL databases may use different query languages or APIs, depending on the type of database. Some use specialized query languages, while others may use programming languages.

**Use Cases:**

1. **SQL:**
   - SQL databases are well-suited for structured data with well-defined relationships.
   - Commonly used for OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) applications.

2. **NoSQL:**
   - NoSQL databases are suitable for unstructured or semi-structured data.
   - Ideal for applications requiring high scalability, such as web applications, real-time analytics, IoT, and more.

**Examples:**

1. **SQL:**
   - MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server

2. **NoSQL:**
   - MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, Redis, Neo4j

Ultimately, the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements of your application. Some projects may even use a combination of both types to leverage their respective strengths for different parts of the system.

## 8. What is the order of execution of sql commands:

In SQL, the logical order of execution for a query involving the `SELECT` statement is as follows:

1. **FROM**: Specifies the source tables or views from which data will be retrieved.

2. **JOIN**: Combines rows from different tables based on specified conditions.

3. **WHERE**: Filters rows based on specified conditions.

4. **GROUP BY**: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns.

5. **HAVING**: Filters grouped rows based on specified conditions.

6. **SELECT**: Retrieves columns or expressions to be displayed in the result set.

7. **DISTINCT**: Removes duplicate rows from the result set.

8. **ORDER BY**: Sorts the result set based on specified columns.

9. **LIMIT/OFFSET**: Retrieves a subset of rows from the result set.

10. **INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE**: Modifies data in the tables.


It's important to understand that this logical order of execution doesn't always reflect the actual physical execution steps taken by the database management system. Modern database systems often use query optimization techniques to reorganize the execution plan for better performance. However, they ensure that the end result adheres to the logical order of execution to produce correct and expected results.

## 9. Different types of database:

Databases can be classified into different types based on various criteria, including their structure, usage, and technology. Here are some common types of databases:

1. **Relational Databases (RDBMS):**
   Relational databases are structured around tables with rows and columns. Data is organized into tables, and relationships between tables are established using keys. Examples of relational database management systems (RDBMS) include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.

2. **NoSQL Databases:**
   NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. They don't rely on a fixed schema like relational databases. Types of NoSQL databases include document databases (e.g., MongoDB), key-value stores (e.g., Redis), column-family stores (e.g., Apache Cassandra), and graph databases (e.g., Neo4j).

3. **Object-Oriented Databases:**
   Object-oriented databases store data as objects, similar to how they are used in object-oriented programming languages. These databases are well-suited for applications that work with complex and interconnected data structures.

4. **Graph Databases:**
   Graph databases are designed to store and manage data in the form of nodes and edges, representing entities and their relationships. They are particularly useful for applications that involve complex relationships and network analysis.

5. **Columnar Databases:**
   Columnar databases store data in columns rather than rows, which can provide significant performance improvements for certain types of analytical queries. They are commonly used for data warehousing and analytics.

6. **Time-Series Databases:**
   Time-series databases specialize in storing and querying time-stamped data, such as sensor readings, financial data, and logs. They are optimized for efficient storage and retrieval of time-series data.

7. **In-Memory Databases:**
   In-memory databases store data entirely in the system's main memory (RAM) rather than on disk. This can greatly enhance data access speed and query performance.

8. **Spatial Databases:**
   Spatial databases are designed to store and manage spatial or geographic data, such as maps, locations, and coordinates. They provide specialized spatial indexing and querying capabilities.

9. **Distributed Databases:**
   Distributed databases are spread across multiple physical or virtual servers. They are designed to handle high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance.

10. **Cloud Databases:**
    Cloud databases are hosted and managed in cloud environments. They can be relational, NoSQL, or specialized databases, and they offer advantages like scalability and managed services.

11. **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) Databases:**
    OLAP databases are designed for complex queries and reporting tasks. They are optimized for analytics and data warehousing.

12. **Document Databases:**
    Document databases store data in flexible, semi-structured documents, such as JSON or XML. They are well-suited for applications where data structures vary and evolve over time.

These are just a few types of databases, and there are many more specialized databases designed for specific use cases and requirements. The choice of database type depends on factors such as the nature of the data, the performance requirements, the application's needs, and scalability considerations.
