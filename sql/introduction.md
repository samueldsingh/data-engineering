# Introduction

## 1. What is DBMS and RDBMS?

DBMS (Database Management System):

A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software system that allows users to interact with a database. It provides a set of tools and functionalities to store, retrieve, update, and manage data efficiently and securely. The main purpose of a DBMS is to provide an organized and structured way to manage data, ensuring data integrity, consistency, and security. Some key features of a DBMS include:

1. Data Organization: DBMS provides methods to organize data into tables, rows, and columns, creating a structured representation of data.

2. Data Retrieval: Users can query the database to retrieve specific data based on certain conditions using SQL (Structured Query Language).

3. Data Manipulation: DBMS allows users to insert, update, and delete data in the database, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

4. Data Security: DBMS provides access control mechanisms to secure data from unauthorized access and ensure data privacy.

5. Data Concurrency: DBMS handles multiple user access to the data concurrently, preventing conflicts and maintaining data consistency.

6. Data Recovery: DBMS has built-in mechanisms for data backup and recovery, protecting data from accidental loss or corruption.

RDBMS (Relational Database Management System):

RDBMS is a type of DBMS that manages data in a relational database model. In the relational model, data is organized into tables with rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established using keys. The key feature of RDBMS is the ability to enforce relationships and constraints between tables through the use of primary keys, foreign keys, and other integrity constraints. Some popular RDBMSs include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.

Key characteristics of RDBMS:

1. Tabular Structure: Data is represented in tables, where each table consists of rows (records) and columns (attributes).

2. Data Integrity: RDBMS enforces integrity constraints such as primary keys, unique keys, foreign keys, and check constraints to maintain data accuracy and consistency.

3. SQL Support: RDBMS uses SQL to perform operations on data, making it easy for users to interact with the database.

4. Normalization: RDBMS encourages data normalization to eliminate data redundancy and improve data integrity.

5. ACID Properties: RDBMS follows ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to ensure data transactions are reliable and recoverable.

6. Data Relationships: RDBMS allows the establishment of relationships between tables using keys, enabling efficient data retrieval through joins.

In summary, both DBMS and RDBMS are software systems used to manage data, but RDBMS is a specific type of DBMS that follows the relational model, providing structured data organization and enforcing data relationships through keys and integrity constraints.

## 2. Examples of DBMS and RDBMS:

Here are examples of both DBMS and RDBMS:

DBMS (Database Management System):

1. MongoDB: MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system that stores data in a flexible JSON-like format called BSON (Binary JSON). It is designed for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data and is commonly used in modern web applications.

2. Couchbase: Couchbase is a NoSQL database management system that supports both document-oriented and key-value data models. It is known for its high performance and scalability and is used in applications that require fast data access and low-latency response times.

3. Redis: Redis is an in-memory data structure store that can function as a database, cache, and message broker. It is widely used for caching frequently accessed data and supporting real-time data analytics.

RDBMS (Relational Database Management System):

1. MySQL: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system known for its speed, reliability, and ease of use. It is widely used in web applications and is the default database for popular content management systems like WordPress.

2. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL is an advanced open-source relational database management system that supports a wide range of features, including custom data types, full-text search, and geospatial data. It is known for its extensibility and adherence to SQL standards.

3. Oracle Database: Oracle Database is a commercial relational database management system developed by Oracle Corporation. It is one of the most popular RDBMS used in enterprise applications and large-scale systems, known for its scalability and high performance.

4. Microsoft SQL Server: SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. It is commonly used in Windows-based environments and integrates well with Microsoft's development tools and products.

5. SQLite: SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, and self-contained relational database management system. It is commonly used in mobile applications, embedded systems, and as a local database for desktop applications.

6. IBM Db2: Db2 is a family of data management products developed by IBM. It is known for its integration with IBM's mainframe systems and is used in enterprise-level applications.

These examples represent a small subset of the many database management systems available, each with its own strengths and best-suited use cases. The choice of a particular DBMS or RDBMS depends on the specific requirements of the application, the complexity of data, scalability needs, and other factors.


## 3. Explain what are ACID properties
ACID properties are a set of four key characteristics that ensure the reliability and consistency of transactions in a database system. These properties are essential for maintaining data integrity and providing a robust environment for data management. The term "ACID" stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. Let's explore each of these properties in detail:

1. Atomicity:
Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit of work. It means that either all the operations within a transaction are successfully completed, or none of them are. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database is left unchanged. This property ensures that the database remains in a consistent state, and partial updates are not allowed.

2. Consistency:
Consistency guarantees that a transaction brings the database from one consistent state to another consistent state. In other words, the database must adhere to a set of predefined rules or constraints before and after a transaction. If a transaction violates any of these rules, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database remains unchanged. Consistency ensures that data remains accurate and valid throughout the transaction.

3. Isolation:
Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions are executed independently of each other. It prevents interference between transactions and ensures that each transaction sees the database in a consistent state. Transactions are executed as if they were the only ones running on the system, even when multiple transactions are happening simultaneously. This property prevents issues like data corruption and ensures data integrity even in a multi-user environment.

4. Durability:
Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, its effects are permanent and will survive any subsequent system failures, such as power outages or crashes. The changes made by a committed transaction are stored in non-volatile memory (usually disk storage) and remain in the database even in the event of a system failure. This property ensures that data is not lost, providing a high level of reliability and recoverability.

The ACID properties are crucial for maintaining data integrity, consistency, and reliability in database management systems. These properties ensure that transactions are executed reliably and that the database remains in a consistent and accurate state even in the presence of failures or concurrent access by multiple users.
