# Examples of  creating a relational database

How do you define a database schema when creating a relational database? How do you structure a database by breaking the data into separate tables (relational database) and form relationships between them using indexes and then construct select queries by joining tables to retrieve your data?

You can create a database schema using a process known as *normalization*.  There are three different relationships in relational databases:
1. One to one relationship
2. One to many relationship
3. Many to many relationship

SQL can then be used to retrieve information using the table joins. 

Some optimization techniques like use of indexes and denormalization using triggers can be used to create a lightining fast database.
