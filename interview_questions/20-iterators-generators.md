## 1. Iterator protocol in python

The iterator protocol defines a standard way to produce a sequence of values (either finite or infinite), and potentially a return value when all values have 
been generated.
An object is an iterator when it implements a `next()` method with the following semantics: 
      
So while working with for loop on sequence, first iter method will be called on iterable object like string list etc., and iterator object will be created.

On iterator object, everytime next method will be called to get next element from sequence.

The iterator protocol in Python allows objects to be iterated or looped over. It defines the methods that need to be implemented in an object to make it iterable. Iterables are objects that can return an iterator, and iterators are objects that keep track of the current position during iteration.

The iterator protocol consists of two main methods: `__iter__()` and `__next__()`. Let's go through each of them:

1. **`__iter__()` Method:**
   This method is responsible for returning the iterator object itself. It's called when an iterable is used in a loop.

2. **`__next__()` Method:**
   This method is used to get the next item from the iterator. It should raise the `StopIteration` exception when there are no more items to be returned.

Here's an example of how to create a custom iterable and iterator using the iterator protocol:

```python
class MyIterator:
    def __init__(self, limit):
        self.limit = limit
        self.current = 0

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.current < self.limit:
            value = self.current
            self.current += 1
            return value
        else:
            raise StopIteration

class MyIterable:
    def __init__(self, limit):
        self.limit = limit

    def __iter__(self):
        return MyIterator(self.limit)

# Using the custom iterable and iterator
my_iterable = MyIterable(5)
for value in my_iterable:
    print(value)
```

In this example, `MyIterable` is an iterable class that defines `__iter__()` to return an instance of `MyIterator`. The `MyIterator` class implements both `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods to create a custom iterator. When the `for` loop is used on `my_iterable`, it creates an instance of `MyIterator` and iterates over its values.

The iterator protocol allows you to create custom iterable and iterator classes for more complex iterations, allowing you to control the behavior of your custom objects in loops and other iteration scenarios.

## 2. Generator protocol in python

Python provides a generator to create your own iterator function. A generator is a special type of function which does not return a single value, instead, 
it returns an iterator object with a sequence of values. In a generator function, a `yield` statement is used rather than a `return` statement. 
Values will be produced lazily in each iteration in generator using `yield` keyword.

The generator protocol in Python provides a convenient and memory-efficient way to create iterators. Generators allow you to iterate over a sequence of values without storing them all in memory at once. This is particularly useful for large datasets or when generating values on-the-fly.

Generators are implemented using functions with the `yield` keyword. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator iterator that can be used to iterate over the sequence of values produced by the `yield` statements in the function.

The generator protocol involves two key aspects:

1. **Generator Function:**
   A generator function is defined using the `def` keyword, just like a regular function. However, instead of using `return` to produce a value, you use the `yield` keyword. The function's state is saved between successive calls, allowing it to resume execution from where it left off.

2. **Generator Iterator:**
   When a generator function is called, it returns a generator iterator. This iterator implements the iterator protocol with `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods. The `__next__()` method executes the generator function until it encounters a `yield` statement, at which point it returns the yielded value. The execution state of the generator function is then saved, and the function can be resumed from that point when the `__next__()` method is called again.

Here's an example of a generator function that generates Fibonacci numbers:

```python
def fibonacci_generator():
    a, b = 0, 1
    while True:
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

# Using the generator to generate Fibonacci numbers
fibonacci = fibonacci_generator()
for _ in range(10):
    print(next(fibonacci))
```

In this example, the `fibonacci_generator()` function is a generator that yields Fibonacci numbers indefinitely. The generator iterator `fibonacci` is used in a loop to generate and print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.

Generators provide an elegant and efficient way to work with sequences of values, especially when dealing with large or infinite datasets. They allow you to produce values one at a time and avoid loading all values into memory simultaneously.

for speed of execution:  we can use iterator which uses `iter` and `next` method calls interally
for memory management :  efficiency we can use generator 

## 3. iterator vs generator

Iterators and generators are related concepts in Python that provide ways to iterate over a sequence of values. However, they have some differences in terms of implementation and usage.

**Iterators:**
An iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol, which includes the methods `__iter__()` and `__next__()`. Iterators are used to iterate over a sequence of values one at a time. They maintain the state of iteration internally and provide the next value whenever `__next__()` is called. Iterators are generally implemented using classes.

Here's an example of an iterator:

```python
class MyIterator:
    def __init__(self, max_value):
        self.max_value = max_value
        self.current = 0

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.current < self.max_value:
            self.current += 1
            return self.current - 1
        else:
            raise StopIteration

# Using the iterator
my_iter = MyIterator(5)
for num in my_iter:
    print(num)
```

**Generators:**
Generators are a type of iterator that are implemented using functions with the `yield` keyword. They provide a more concise and memory-efficient way to create iterators. A generator function returns a generator iterator, and when the `yield` statement is encountered, the function's state is saved, allowing it to resume execution from that point.

Here's an example of a generator:

```python
def my_generator(max_value):
    current = 0
    while current < max_value:
        yield current
        current += 1

# Using the generator
gen = my_generator(5)
for num in gen:
    print(num)
```

**Differences:**

1. **Implementation:** Iterators are generally implemented using classes and require defining `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods. Generators are implemented using functions with the `yield` keyword.

2. **Memory Efficiency:** Generators are more memory-efficient as they generate values on-the-fly and don't store all values in memory. Iterators can be memory-intensive if they store all values in memory at once.

3. **Conciseness:** Generators are often more concise since they don't require defining a separate class and methods.

4. **State:** In generators, the state is saved automatically when the `yield` statement is encountered. In iterators, you need to manage the state explicitly.

In summary, both iterators and generators provide ways to iterate over values, but generators offer a more convenient and memory-efficient approach, especially for large or infinite sequences of values.
