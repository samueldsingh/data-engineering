    - Eclipse: F11 followed by F11 again

These shortcuts may vary slightly depending on the IDE or code editor you're using. It's recommended to refer to the documentation of your specific development environment to find the exact shortcuts for debugging operations. Mastering these shortcuts can significantly improve your efficiency while debugging code and help you identify and fix issues more quickly.

## 3. pdb module

The `pdb` module in Python is a built-in debugging tool that stands for "Python Debugger." It provides an interactive command-line interface for debugging Python programs. The `pdb` module allows you to set breakpoints, step through code, inspect variables, and track the flow of execution in your programs. It's a powerful tool for diagnosing and fixing issues in your code.

Here's how you can use the `pdb` module to debug your Python programs:

1. **Import the `pdb` Module**: Start by importing the `pdb` module at the beginning of your script.

   ```python
   import pdb
   ```

2. **Set Breakpoints**: Place the `pdb.set_trace()` function call at the point in your code where you want the debugger to start. This is typically where you suspect an issue or want to inspect variables.

   ```python
   def calculate_total(a, b):
       total = a + b
       pdb.set_trace()  # Debugger will stop here
       return total

   result = calculate_total(5, 7)
   ```

3. **Run the Program**: When you run your script, execution will pause when it reaches the `pdb.set_trace()` line, and you'll enter the debugger prompt.

4. **Debugger Commands**: Once you're in the debugger prompt, you can use various commands to navigate and inspect your code. Some common commands include:

   - `n` or `next`: Execute the current line and move to the next line.
   - `s` or `step`: Step into a function call.
   - `c` or `continue`: Continue execution until the next breakpoint.
   - `q` or `quit`: Exit the debugger and stop the program.
   - `p variable_name`: Print the value of a variable.
   - `l` or `list`: Show the source code around the current line.
   - `h` or `help`: Display help for debugger commands.

5. **Continue Debugging**: You can use the debugger commands to navigate through your code, inspect variables, and identify issues. The debugger will guide you through each step of the execution.

6. **Exiting the Debugger**: Once you've finished debugging, you can exit the debugger using the `q` or `quit` command. This will terminate the program if it's still running.

The `pdb` module provides a straightforward way to perform interactive debugging directly within your Python code. It's especially useful for identifying errors, understanding the flow of execution, and inspecting variable values. Keep in mind that while the `pdb` module is powerful, there are also more feature-rich and user-friendly debugging tools available, especially within integrated development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and others.

## 4. pdb module commands

The `pdb` module provides a variety of commands that you can use while debugging your Python code. These commands help you navigate through the code, inspect variables, and control the flow of execution. Here are some of the commonly used `pdb` commands:

1. `h` or `help`: Display a list of available commands or get help for a specific command.
2. `q` or `quit`: Exit the debugger and terminate the program.
3. `n` or `next`: Continue execution until the next line in the current function is reached.
4. `s` or `step`: Execute the current line and stop at the first possible occasion (either in a called function or at the next line).
5. `c` or `continue`: Continue execution until the next breakpoint is encountered.
6. `l` or `list`: Show the source code around the current line. It will display the 11 lines around the current line by default.
7. `p` or `print`: Print the value of a variable.
   Example: `p variable_name`
8. `pp`: Pretty-print the value of an expression.
9. `a` or `args`: Print the arguments passed to the current function.
10. `w` or `where`: Print a stack trace, showing the list of active frames.
11. `u` or `up`: Move the current frame one level up in the stack trace.
12. `d` or `down`: Move the current frame one level down in the stack trace.
13. `b` or `break`: Set a breakpoint at a specific line number or function name.
   Example: `b filename:line_number` or `b function_name`
14. `cl` or `clear`: Clear a breakpoint at a specific line number.
   Example: `cl filename:line_number`
15. `disable`: Disable a breakpoint at a specific line number or function name.
16. `enable`: Enable a disabled breakpoint.
17. `r` or `return`: Continue execution until the current function returns.
18. `j` or `jump`: Set the next line that will be executed. Use with caution.
   Example: `j line_number`
19. `tbreak`: Temporary breakpoint. It behaves like a breakpoint but is automatically removed after being hit.
   Example: `tbreak filename:line_number`
20. `list breakpoints` or `b`: List all breakpoints that have been set.
21. `commands`: Set a list of debugger commands to run when a breakpoint is hit.

These are just some of the many commands available in the `pdb` module. You can use them to control the debugger's behavior, inspect variables, step through code, and analyze the flow of execution in your Python program. To get detailed information about any command, you can use the `h` or `help` command followed by the command's name.

Remember that the `pdb` module provides an interactive debugger, so you can experiment with these commands directly in the debugger prompt to understand how they work and how they can help you debug your code effectively.
