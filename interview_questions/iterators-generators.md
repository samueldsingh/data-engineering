When you want speed of execution, iterator is preferred and when you want efficient memory management, generator is preferred. Iterators are methods that are used to
iterate over or loop through sequenced iterables like lists and tuples. A Python iterator object must implement two special methods, `__iter__()` and `__next__()`, 
collectively called the iterator protocol.
