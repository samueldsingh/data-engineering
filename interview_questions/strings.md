## Important string functions:
- centre (returns a space-padded string)
- count (counts how many times str occurs in string or in a substring of string)
- find (determine if str occurs in string or in a substring of string),
- index (finds the index of the first occurrence of a substring within a given string)
- join (concatenates the string representations of elements in sequence seq into a string)
- replace (replaces all occurrences of old in string with new)
- split (splits string according to delimiter str)
- strip (performs both lstrip() and rstrip() on string)
