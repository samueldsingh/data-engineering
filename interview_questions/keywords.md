# VI. Keywords:
=====================
### 1. Explain all keywords with examples and areas of usage

- In Python, keywords are reserved words that have special meanings and are used to define the syntax and structure of the language. 
- These keywords cannot be used as variable names or identifiers because they are already predefined and have specific functionalities assigned to them.

- There are 35 keywords in Python:
```
False      class      finally    is         return
None       continue   for        lambda     try
True       def        from       nonlocal   while
and        del        global     not        with
as         elif       if         or         yield
assert     else       import     pass
break      except     in         raise
```
