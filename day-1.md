## Operators

Python Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

Python divides the operators in the following groups:
- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Identity operators
- Membership operators
- Bitwise operators

## Python Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:
`+, -, *, /, %, **, //`

## Python Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:
`=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=, &=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<=`
